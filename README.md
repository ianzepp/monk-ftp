# Monk FTP Server

## Executive Summary

**FTP Protocol Bridge** - Standalone TypeScript FTP server providing traditional FTP client compatibility with the Monk API PaaS platform, acting as a protocol translation layer between legacy FTP clients and modern HTTP APIs.

### Project Overview
- **Language**: TypeScript/Node.js with custom FTP protocol implementation
- **Purpose**: FTP protocol server for Monk API integration and legacy client compatibility
- **Architecture**: Protocol translation bridge converting FTP commands to HTTP API calls
- **Integration**: Seamless bridge between FTP clients and Monk API backend
- **Design**: Command-based architecture with individual FTP command handlers

### Key Features
- **Complete FTP Protocol**: Full implementation of standard FTP server functionality
- **Monk API Integration**: Direct translation of FTP operations to Monk API HTTP endpoints
- **Legacy Compatibility**: Support for traditional FTP clients and workflows
- **Command Architecture**: Modular FTP command implementation with 16 command handlers
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication integration with Monk API
- **File Operations**: Complete file upload, download, listing, and management capabilities

### Technical Architecture
- **FTP Server Framework** (21 TypeScript files):
  - `src/index.ts`: Main FTP server entry point and configuration
  - `src/lib/ftp-server.ts`: Core FTP protocol server implementation
  - `src/lib/base-command.ts`: Abstract base class for FTP command handlers
  - `src/commands/*.ts`: Individual FTP command implementations (16 commands)
  - `src/lib/api-client.ts`: HTTP client for Monk API communication
- **Protocol Implementation**: Custom FTP protocol handling and response management
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with both TypeScript and shell script tests

### FTP Command Support
**Implemented Commands** (16 total):
- **Connection Management**: `USER`, `PASS`, `CLNT`
- **Directory Operations**: `PWD`, `CWD`, `CDUP`, `LIST`
- **File Operations**: `RETR` (download), `STOR` (upload), `APPE` (append)
- **File Information**: `SIZE`, `MDTM` (modify time), `STAT`
- **File Management**: `DELE` (delete)
- **Transfer Mode**: `PASV` (passive mode)
- **Help**: `HELP` (command assistance)

### Protocol Translation
- **FTP â†’ HTTP**: Converts FTP commands to appropriate Monk API HTTP requests
- **Authentication Bridge**: FTP user/pass authentication mapped to JWT tokens
- **File System Abstraction**: Virtual file system backed by Monk API data structures
- **Response Translation**: HTTP API responses converted to proper FTP protocol responses
- **Error Handling**: API errors properly translated to FTP error codes

### Integration Architecture
- **Monk API Backend**: Full integration with Monk API PaaS platform
- **HTTP API Client**: Robust HTTP client for API communication
- **Authentication Flow**: Seamless authentication between FTP and API layers
- **Data Mapping**: FTP file operations mapped to Monk API data operations
- **Legacy Bridge**: Enables legacy FTP workflows with modern API backends

### Development Features
- **TypeScript Implementation**: Full type safety and modern development patterns
- **Modular Commands**: Each FTP command implemented as separate TypeScript module
- **Hot Reload**: Development server with automatic TypeScript compilation
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Test coverage for both protocol and integration functionality
- **CLI Support**: Command-line interface for server management and operation

### Legacy Integration Benefits
- **Traditional FTP Clients**: Works with any standard FTP client (FileZilla, WinSCP, etc.)
- **Legacy Workflow Support**: Enables existing FTP-based processes without migration
- **Gradual Migration**: Allows gradual transition from FTP to modern API workflows
- **Protocol Compatibility**: Full FTP RFC compliance for broad client support
- **Enterprise Integration**: Bridge legacy enterprise FTP processes with modern APIs

### Use Cases
- **Legacy System Integration**: Connect traditional FTP workflows with modern APIs
- **File Management Interface**: Provide familiar FTP interface for API-based file operations
- **Migration Bridge**: Gradual transition from FTP-based to API-based file management
- **Enterprise Compatibility**: Support existing enterprise FTP-based processes
- **Development Tools**: FTP interface for API development and testing workflows

### Performance & Security
- **Efficient Translation**: Optimized FTP-to-HTTP protocol conversion
- **Secure Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with Monk API security model
- **Connection Management**: Robust FTP connection handling and session management
- **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive error handling for both protocol and API layers
- **Resource Optimization**: Efficient memory and connection management

### Archive Value
Excellent reference for:
- **Protocol Bridge Development**: FTP-to-HTTP protocol translation patterns
- **Legacy Integration Architecture**: Connecting traditional protocols with modern APIs
- **TypeScript Protocol Implementation**: Custom protocol server development in TypeScript
- **Command Pattern Implementation**: Modular command architecture for protocol servers
- **API Integration Patterns**: HTTP API client integration within protocol servers

Essential example of protocol bridge development and legacy system integration, demonstrating how to connect traditional file transfer protocols with modern API infrastructure.
